The project aims at classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into multiple categories. The CIFAR-10 dataset is an image dataset that consists of 60000 32x32 colour images categorized in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The classes are namely airplane, automobile, bird, cat, dog, deer, frog, horse, ship and truck. The classes are mutually exclusive ones. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks. "Automobile" includes sedans and SUVs. "Truck" includes only big trucks. It does not include pickup trucks.
